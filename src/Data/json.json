      "articleBody": "- Flamengo are unbeaten in 11 games in all competitions (W8, D3) - Bayern Munich lost to Benfica in the last round of group-stage games - Recommended bet: Flamengo to winBrazilian big guns Flamengo managed to finish ahead of Chelsea in Group D of the FIFA Club World Cup but taking top spot has perhaps resulted in a tougher draw in the last 16 as they face German giants Bayern Munich.Bayern kicked off their CWC bid with a 10-0 mauling of part-timers Auckland City before overcoming Boca Juniors 2-1. The Bavarians rotated for their final group game with a place in the knockout stages already secured, and went down 1-0 to Benfica.&nbsp;Team newsBoth of these teams were able to rest a few players in the final round of group games and they should revert to their best respective starting sides on Sunday.Nicolas de la Cruz is unavailable for Flamengo but Gerson, Erick Pulgar, Jorginho, Ayrton Lucas, Leo Pereira&nbsp; and Gonzalo Plata should all start.Harry Kane Michael Olise, Kingsley Coman and Jonathan Tah should come back into the starting Bayern side.&nbsp;The latest Flamengo vs Bayern Munich odds are available on LiveScore BetThe statsundefinedFlamengo lead the way in Brazil’s Serie A with 24 points from 11 games.Bayern have suffered two defeats in their last 11 games.&nbsp;Flamengo had an xG of 3.0 in their 3-1 win over Chelsea.&nbsp;Flamengo have seven clean sheets in their last 10 games.The latest Flamengo vs Bayern Munich odds are available on LiveScore BetPredictionBayern are the clear favourites to win but as big price underdogs, Flamengo look worth the risk in this intriguing Club World Cup clash.The Brazilian outfit were dominant in their 3-1 win over Chelsea and come into this game fresh after taking the opportunity to rotate for their dead-rubber fixture with LAFC.Bayern have perhaps yet to get going at this tournament. The Bundesliga champions won a one-sided game against Auckland City and then ground out a 2-1 win over Boca Juniors, and the fact the Argentine outfit were then held to a draw by Auckland suggests Bayern are not quite firing on all cylinders in the USA.Flamengo boss Filipe Luis has made his side an incredibly tight defensive unit and that could give them an edge over Bayern. The German side had the Bundesliga title wrapped up with two games to spare and then did not have a serious test in the group stages as their clash with Benfica came at a point when they had already qualified.In contrast, Flamengo are locked in as they came to this competition whilst the Brazilian Serie A is still ongoing. Luis’ side have had a chance to play themselves into some form as well in their first three games and they are one of the most well supported teams at this competition, drawing a huge crowd for their win over Chelsea. They look more than capable of pulling off an upset when they take on Bayern on Sunday.&nbsp;Back Flamengo to win at 21/5 with Live Score Bet.Win up to £250,000 with LiveScore 6!Win up to £250,000 with our free-to-play game, LiveScore 6!Predict the score of all six LiveScore 6 fixtures for your chance to win. 18+, UK/Ireland residents only, T&amp;Cs apply.",
